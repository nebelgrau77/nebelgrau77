### Hello world! :robot:

I decided to learn something about data science, so I found out about Python and started with that. I was curious about electronics, and thought this would help me learn programming in general, so I also started tinkering with MicroPython on Espressif and STM32 devices. Then I decided to try C, and discovered Rust. 

It seemed scattered all over the place for a while, but some pattern emerged at some point, so to speak. Learning about data, machine learning, neural networks and microcontrollers led to my interest in TinyML, that is machine learning on small, low power devices. 

I'm currently working on:
* small CLI and TUI Rust programs, mainly for some sort of data processing, e.g. using SQLite, parsing or generating a file, and so on
* conversion of the code from "Deep Learning on ARM microntrollers from scratch" Udemy course into Rust
* some small neural network projects, both desktop (model training) and embedded (inference)

Mine are constant learning / hobby project, which hopefully could lead to a career transition.
